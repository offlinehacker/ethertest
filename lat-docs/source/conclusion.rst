What we found out is that you can get pretty secure with iptables, encrypted packets
and so on, but in the end the biggest security hole is like always, the user alone.
Human naivety and negligence knows no limits and that is commonly exploited by
atttackers either by phisically exploiting us or through an outside attack on the network.

Even when you think you are secure, belive me, you are actually not! Goood hackers
will still find a way into the system, but at least you will be able to mitigate
attacks the best way possible and at leasr less damage will be done. At the same time
you will have the knowledge about what have the the attackers done to you or your
clients and you'll be able to fix that what's needed.
