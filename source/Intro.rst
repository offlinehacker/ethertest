Networks tend to be very complex these days. We have many protocols
that we have to take care of, all from ethernet, arp, ipv4, ipv6, and
higher application protocols. At the same time we want to keep network
secure against intruders and log whatever is going on.

Some people have unlimited brain power and memory capacity or some people
are just network administrators configuring networks day by day and knowing 
all the tricks what's going on.
Well i'm only a developer and i forget things all the time. I don't have money
to buy ninja network administrator i have to configure network by myself and
every time i configure it, i'm asking myself; Is it secure? Is it running as
it should?
As a developer i have to write tests, to keep sure everything is working
correctly and i like to reuse code as much as possible. Meybe i am lazy
or i just have health problems and i rather spend more time doing excerises.

Well i deciced to be as good as those network administrators and not
just that, but even better. I decided to take developer aproach to
working and secure network. Because i'm studing telecomunications i
decide to spend some time making this document for good practices for
tested and secure ip networks.
