Virtualization
**************

There are many way you can virtualize your network environemnt. Usually it
just does not matter  as long as you have a way to virtualize your network 
elements and setup virtual network.

Here i will show one example how to use virtualbox for virtualization and use
linux virtual machines for network elements. I will use virtualbox, because
deployment of virtual machines can be automated using `Vagrant http://vagrantup.com/>`_

.. note::

    If anybody wants to make an examples with some other network infrastructure
    like mikrotik, cisco, there exists those virtual machines and i will be 
    very pleased to include tutorial how to include those.

Installation
------------

First you need to download and install virtualbox from `<https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_ 
and vagrant from `<http://downloads.vagrantup.com/>`_. I recomend the latest stable release.
