=======================
The testing enivronment
=======================

-------------------------
Why we took this approach
-------------------------

There are lots of different alternatives for testing network security, there are
plenty of commercial router emulators. But every one of them misses something
and are not entirely custumizable. That's why we chose Vagrant to setup our
virtual environment (using Oracle's virtualbox virtualization software, where we
can run practically what we wish) and scapy to manage and create test packets to
send through our networks.


Project components
------------------

The following is used to run the project::

-Developing: Python 2.7
-Running the virtual environment: Virtualbox 4.2.4 or newer
-Deploying the test system: Vagrant 1.0.5 or newer
-Testing purposes: scapy
-System packages needed: iptables, tunctl, dnsmasq


:term:`Vagrant`

Vagrant uses Oracleâ€™s VirtualBox to build configurable, lightweight, and portable
virtual machines dynamically. After that it uses Puppet to provision them. That
means it can deploy the entire testing system with the configurations made by us.
From running a router with preconfigured routing to simulating a private machine
getting an IP with dhcp from the router.

:term:`Puppet`

It gives us the ability to configure the virtual machines once they are set up.
That means it can install applications, manage and configure the system so they
appear and behave as we wish. For example it can set up the machines with different
network adapterswith different configurations, like using DHCP to get an IP from
the router or setting static IPs.

:term:`scapy`

The author says it all: "Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program.
It is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them
on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more. It can easily
handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests,
attacks or network discovery (it can replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk,
arping, tcpdump, tethereal, p0f, etc.). It also performs very well at a lot of
other specific tasks that most other tools can't handle, like sending invalid
frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics (VLAN hopping+ARP
cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted channel, ...), etc."

-------------------------
How to setup the system
-------------------------

This  is  a step by step how-to on setting up the testing environment. The following
directions are based for machines running Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10.

System requierments:
____________________

* Any moderen linux distribution supported by vagrant and virtualbox
* x86_64 or any other arhitecture supported by virtualbox,
  hardware virtualization is not a requierment.
* 2GB or more memory

.. note::

    VirtualBox can run inside os-based virtualization like openvz or lxc,
    that's also why we use bridged networking inside virtual boxes (host-only does not work).

Requierments:
_____________

* Python 2.7
* `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_
* `Vagrant <http://downloads.vagrantup.com>`_
* System packages: `iptables`, `tunctl`, `dnsmasq`

Development
-----------

    ::

    $ git clone git@github.com:offlinehacker/ethertest.git
    $ git submodule update
    $ cd ethertest
    $ python setup.py develop
    $ vagrant gem install vagrant-hiera
    $ vagrant up [name]

Update

    ::

        $ git pull origin master
        $ git submodule update --init
        $ vagrant destroy [name](only if you are having problems)
        $ vagrant up [name]

    .. note::
        
        You don't need to destroy::
        
        $ vagrant provision

        should do the task in most cases. If you are having problems first try
        to halt or reload you virtual machines::

        $ vagrant halt -f [name]
        $ vagrant reload [name]

Ubuntu 12.04/12.10 instructions

  .. note::

    To activate and deactivate python virtual environment use
    "$ source bin/activate" and "deactivate" commands.

  .. note::

     If you are having problems with installing vagrant try installing the x64 version.
    ::

    $ wget http://files.vagrantup.com/packages/be0bc66efc0c5919e92d8b79e973d9911f2a511f/vagrant_1.0.5_x86_64.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i vagrant_1.0.5_x86_64.deb

  .. note::

    If you're having problems developing setup.py try installing numpy before running it::

    $ pip install numpy
    

Bringing up virtual box-es
--------------------------

  .. note::

    Configurations for the virtual boxes are located inside `Vagrantfile`.

* Please make sure `tunctl`, `dnsmasq` and `iptables` commands are installed.

  .. note::

    There must be no dnsmasq process running else vagrant won't start up.
    Check it with::

    $ ps -e | grep dnsmasq

    If the output shows dnsmasq running, kill it with::

    $ sudo killall dnsmasq

* First of all we need to start the network, dhcp server and nat. The following
  commands also create new network interfaces:

  ::

    $ fab netstart
    $ fab dhcp
    $ fab natstart:[interface with internet connectivity]

  .. note::

    Configuration for network subnets(interfaces) are located inside `fabfile.py`.
    `VirtualBox` will bridge with virtual intefaces as specified inside `Vagrantfile`.

* To bring-up a virtual box use::

        $ vagrant up [name]

  .. note::

    In the included configuration the virtualboxes are Router, Priv(a private network),
    Prod(a development/production network)

  .. note::

    If getting errors about vagrant-hiera missing, please install it before running vagrant:

    ::

    $ vagrant gem install vagrant-hiera

* To shut down a virtual box use
  
  ::

    $ vagrant halt [name]

* If the box refuses to terminate try this instead::

    $ vagrant halt [name] -f

  .. note::

    You can also run virtualbox to debug and control your running virtualboxes.

  .. warning::

    If `vagrant` command is not avalible you must setup your search `PATH` variable.
    You can set it by doing the following::

        $ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/vagrant/bin

    To make it persistent add it at the bottom of your `~/.profile` file.

* To ssh to a virtualbox use::

    $ vagrant ssh [name]

Network topology
----------------

Network topology is the connection, arrangement or structure of a network.
There are two categories of topology, :term:`Physical topology` which refers to
the placement of the physical network components (be it routers, cables, etc.)
and :term:`Logical topology` that shows how data fows through a network.

We divide them in 4 basic topologies which form all the possible network forms.
    - bus
    - star
    - ring
    - mesh

**Bus topology**

This topology consists of network elements connected to a single, shared cable.

.. image:: _static/NetworkTopology-Bus.png

Pros:
    - cheap, economic cabling
    - the medium is cheap and easy to handle
    - easy to setup 
    - easy to upgrade

Cons:
    - slows down when the network traffic rises
    - errors are hard to notice
    - interruption of the medium means network goes down

**Star topology**

Each nework host is connected directly with a central device called a hub or switch.

.. image:: _static/NetworkTopology-Star.png

Pros:
    - easy connection of new hosts
    - error on a device or cable doesn't mean the netork does down
    - offers the possibility of a centralized control and management

Cons:
    - if the central device errs, the entire network goes down
    - lots of cabling needed

**Ring topology**

Devices in this topology form a circle. Data travels in one direction and each device
serves for keeping the signal strong. That means every device has to have a reciever for
the incoming signal and a transmiter for the outbound signal.

.. image:: _static/NetworkTopology-Ring.png

Pros:
    - no device has higher priority, they are equivalent
    - network load doesn't increase with more hosts
    - high connection reliability

Cons:
    - error on a device or cable means network goes down
    - errors are hard to notice
    - netork upgrade means connection down

**Mesh topology**

This topology connects each device with all the others in the netowrk,

.. image:: _static/NetworkTopology-FullyConnected.png

Pros:
    - the system is stable because of the redundant connections

Cons:
    - expensive

Our network configuration
--------------------------

Our network topology is of a star type. It consists of a router, a private and a production
host, plus it has an internet virtualbox, which emulates "the outside". The router acts as a
central hub, routing all connections from the internet (extsrv) to and from the other two hosts
(priv and prod). It also contains ip routing tables.

Private network
_________________

This network emulates a typical household computer with dynamically assigned
IPs.

  .. note::

    Configuration file /puppets/manifests/priv.pp

  ::

    ifconfig { "private":
        device => "eth1",
        family => "inet",
        changes => [
                "set method dhcp",
            ],
    }

    ifconfig { "private_inet6":
        device => "eth1",
        family => "inet6",
        changes => [
                "set method auto",
            ],
    }

  Connected to the router's 'eth2' interface

* Production network

  This network emulates a production or development network with static IPs

  .. note::

    Configuration file /puppets/manifests/prod.pp

  ::

    ifconfig { "prod":
        device => "eth1",
        family => "inet",
        changes => [
                "set method static",
                "set address 10.2.0.10",
                "set netmask 255.255.255.0",
                "set network 10.2.0.0",
                "set gateway 10.2.0.1"
            ],
    }

    ifconfig { "prod_inet6":
        device => "eth1",
        family => "inet6",
        changes => [
                "set method static",
                "set address 2001:db8:0:2::10",
                "set netmask 64",
                "set gateway 2001:db8:0:2::1",
            ],
    }
  

  Connected to the router's 'eth3' interface
