==================
IPv6 configuration
==================

It should be very easy to turn on ipv6 support and enable it to work, that
was the core idea of ipv6. You don't need dhcp anymore, everyone gets ipv6
address for free and basicly everything gets configured automatically.
That's for client, but what should we do for router to make it work?

Well it turns out if you do that, you will be mostly very insecure. Not
only that some old attacks affect you, but there are also new attacks that
affect ipv6 users. To make ipv6 secure you must configure it corretly and
test configurations.
